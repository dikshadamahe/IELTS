# üìò IELTS Precision & Progress ‚Äî Design System

Version 2.0 ¬∑ Updated September 27, 2025  
Purpose: Align every touchpoint of the IELTS Precision & Progress experience with a confident, academic, modern brand that inspires measurable improvement.

---

## 1. Brand Identity

**Tone of voice** ‚Äî Confident, academic, modern, professional. Messaging should feel like guidance from a trusted mentor who has seen hundreds of successful IELTS journeys.

**Target audience** ‚Äî Students and young professionals (18‚Äì35) preparing for IELTS Academic or General Training while balancing study, work, and relocation goals.

**Core concept** ‚Äî *Precision + Progress*. Interfaces must communicate structure, clarity, and ambition. Every touchpoint should reassure learners that their preparation is data-driven and momentum-building.

Key translation in UI:

- Precision ‚Üí clean layouts, tight typographic hierarchy, crystal-clear navigation.
- Progress ‚Üí motion and metrics that show forward movement (progress bars, glowing badges, demonstrable stats).
- Confidence ‚Üí bold blue headings, decisive CTAs, crisp interactions with no playful wobble.

## 2. Color System

### Primary palette

| Token | Name | HEX | RGB | Meaning | Primary usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `color-primary` | Deep Royal Blue | `#1A2B6D` | 26, 43, 109 | Trust & authority | Headings, hero backgrounds, nav states |
| `color-emerald` | Vibrant Emerald Green | `#1DB954` | 29, 185, 84 | Growth & action | Links, CTAs, progress indicators |
| `color-amber` | Warm Golden Amber | `#FFB547` | 255, 181, 71 | Achievement & premium | Achievement badges, highlights |

### Neutral palette

| Token | Name | HEX | RGB | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `color-gray-light` | Cool Gray Light | `#F4F6F8` | 244, 246, 248 | Background surfaces, section fill |
| `color-gray-medium` | Cool Gray Medium | `#D9DEE2` | 217, 222, 226 | Borders, dividers, subtle outlines |
| `color-charcoal` | Charcoal Black | `#101214` | 16, 18, 20 | Body copy, iconography, max contrast |

> **Usage rules**  
> - Backgrounds default to white or `color-gray-light`.  
> - Body text must use `color-charcoal`. H1‚ÄìH3 can use `color-primary`; interactive links and CTAs use `color-emerald`.  
> - Use `color-amber` sparingly for badges or key highlights; never cover large surfaces with it.  
> - Avoid combining more than two brand colors in the same region; lean on neutrals for balance.  
> - Ensure contrast ratios stay AA compliant (emerald text must be ‚â•16px on light backgrounds).

Tokens are available as CSS variables (`--color-*`) in `src/index.css`, mirrored in Tailwind via `tailwind.config.js`, and exported as JSON in `src/assets/design-tokens.json`.

## 3. Typography

### Font stack

- **Headings:** Poppins (preferred) ‚Üí Montserrat ‚Üí system sans. Bold, geometric, confident.
- **Body copy:** Source Sans Pro ‚Üí Inter ‚Üí system sans. Optimised for clarity and long-form reading.
- **Accents & quotes:** Merriweather italic ‚Üí Georgia ‚Üí serif. Used only for testimonials, quotes, highlighted statements.

Fonts are streamed from Google Fonts in `index.html` and mapped in Tailwind under `fontFamily.headings`, `fontFamily.body`, and `fontFamily.accent`.

### Type scale (desktop ‚Üí mobile)

| Style | Weight | Desktop size | Mobile size | Color guidance | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | 700 | 48px | 32px | `color-primary` | Hero headlines |
| H2 | 600 | 36px | 28px | `color-primary` | Section headings |
| H3 | 500 | 28px | 22px | `color-primary` | Card titles, sub-sections |
| Body Large | 400 | 18px | 16px | `color-charcoal` | Lead paragraphs |
| Body Small | 400 | 14px | 12px | `color-charcoal` or `color-gray-medium` | Nav links, metadata |
| Quotes (accent) | 400 italic | 18px | 16px | `color-charcoal` or `color-emerald` accent | Testimonials |

Usage rules:

- Headings must always use the Poppins stack; never render Merriweather in a heading level.  
- Line-height across body copy: 1.4‚Äì1.6 for readability.  
- Reserve bold for headings and key emphasis; avoid all-caps body paragraphs.  
- Quote blocks use Merriweather italic with generous padding and accent color.

## 4. Layout & Grid

- **Grid system:** 12-column responsive grid capped at 1200‚ÄØpx, centred via Tailwind `container`.  
- **Gutters:** Minimum 24‚ÄØpx between columns on desktop; stack to full-width on mobile.  
- **Section padding:** 64‚ÄØpx top/bottom on desktop (`py-section-gap`), 32‚ÄØpx on mobile.  
- **Card padding:** 24‚ÄØpx internal padding, radius 16‚ÄØpx or greater.  
- **Spacing scale (px):** 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64. Utilities exposed as Tailwind spacing tokens (`space-4`, `space-6`, etc.).  
- **Container behaviour:** Always centre align key sections, leaving ample whitespace to reinforce clarity.

## 5. Components

### Navbar

- Height 72‚ÄØpx. Logo left, nav links right (max five).  
- Transparent at page top; on scroll, shift to solid Deep Royal Blue with subtle blur and shadow.  
- Links use Body Small typography, uppercase tracking, and emerald underline that expands from centre in 0.2‚ÄØs.  
- CTA: pill-shaped, emerald background, white text, amber glow on hover.

### Hero section

- Split layout: text left, illustration/right asset. White or subtle blue‚Üígray gradient background.  
- H1 uses Poppins Bold Deep Royal Blue; supporting copy in Body Large.  
- Primary CTA button: solid emerald. Secondary CTA: outline blue.

## 6. Interaction Patterns

- **Hover animations** ‚Äî Links: underline grows from centre. Buttons: subtle scale (1.03) and shadow pop. Cards: lift + emerald/amber glow.  
- **Sticky progress bar** ‚Äî Slim emerald bar sits directly beneath the navbar, tracking scroll progress across sections; width updates smoothly on scroll.  
- **Achievement badges** ‚Äî Pill/circular badges with amber border. On hover/focus, show subtle glow; never use playful bounce.  
- **Motion principles** ‚Äî Keep timing 200‚ÄØms ease-out for hover states, 400‚ÄØms+ for scroll-based transitions. Effects should feel refined, not gamified.  
- **Accessibility** ‚Äî Ensure focus states are visible (emerald outline). Animations must respect reduced-motion preferences.
